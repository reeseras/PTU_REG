# PTU_REG
Pokemon Tabletop United Random Encounter Generator

## Summary
Pokemon Tabletop United Random Encounter Generator is a mobile app which uses PokeAPI to randomly generate a pokemon encounter for PTU based on filters input by the user.

## Problem
Pokemon Tabletop United is like Dungeons and Dragons but with pokemon. One of the hardest and most time consuming activities for a Game Master (GM) is creating each individual pokemon character sheet for every encounter. A battle with 3 trainers could include anywhere between 3 to 18 pokemon.

## Solution
PTU REG allows wild encounters to be quickly and easily created by adjusting filters. Encounters can be made on the spot, giving the GM more time to work on the actual campaign rather than the random encounters.
